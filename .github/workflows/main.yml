Hello,

In step 0.3 in Lab 6, it says to open ".github/workflows/deploy.yml", but I don't seem to have this in my repo? Do we need to make this manually? If we need to make it manually, what contents should go in this file?

Hi, it doesn't have to be deploy.yml. Assuming that you have some .yml file set up to trigger Github actions for page deployment (generally present in .github/workflows), use that file for this step. 

If you are setting it up for the first time, here is a sample of what my file looks like:
